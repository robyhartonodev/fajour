        "Believing in Christ is not just intellectually agreeing that he is Lord and Savior. True faith involves obeying his words (Lk 6:46-49). We are saved by grace through faith, but faith without deeds is not true faith (Jas 2:14–20). Even the demons believe that Jesus is the Son of God (Mt 8:28–29; Lk 4:41), but their belief is not true faith (Jas 2:19-20). We cannot dismiss the necessity of baptism since baptism itself is part of and an act of, belief and faith in Jesus Christ (Mk 16:16; see Acts 16:30-33)."

      "answers": [
        "Belief in the Lord Jesus also consists of belief in and following his word (Jn 5:24; see Lk 6:46-49). This is why Paul and Silas “spoke the word of the Lord to [the jailer] and to all who were in his house” (Acts 16:32). And having believed in the word, “immediately he and all his family were baptized” (Acts 16:33). There are many similar examples in which converts were baptized immediately after they had accepted the gospel (Acts 2:41; 8:12, 35-36; 9:18; 10:44-48; 16:14-15; 18:8).",

John said, “I indeed baptize you with water unto [eis] repentance” (Mt 3:11). This is the same language as “for [eis] the remission of sins” (Lk 3:3; Acts 2:38). Baptism does not bring about, but is a result of, repentance. Likewise, baptism does not bring about, but is the result of, the forgiveness of sins.",

        "The Greek word eis means “for” and is rarely used to mean “in view of.” That is why the Bible translators chose “for” instead of anything else.",
        "If we were to read Mt 3:11 as “I baptize you with water as a result of repentance,” the force of the language would be lost. The correct interpretation would be that the ministry of John, which was to baptize, would bring about the effect of repentance among the people. (This effect is general—the effect of leading people to repentance. It does not mean that the action of baptism causes inward repentance of the individual being baptized). So the meaning of [eis] in this case is still “for,” not “in view of” or “as a result of.”",

      "answers": [
        "It is true that the Bible uses water as a symbol for the Holy Spirit (e.g. Jn 7:37-39). But to interpret the water in John 3:5 and the washing in Tit 3:5 as only referring to the Holy Spirit would be forced because water and Spirit are mentioned together in Jn 3:5 and washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit are mentioned together in Tit 3:5. The reason Jn 3:6-8 emphasizes Spirit rather than water is that Jesus was speaking of a spiritual rebirth, not a physical one (Jn 3:6). In fact, baptism and receiving of the Holy Spirit are closely related and together they comprise the spiritual rebirth of which Jesus was speaking. To be born of the Spirit, we need to accept baptism and live a new life according to the Spirit.",
        "The Bible clearly teaches spiritual rebirth through baptism. Rebirth involves receiving a new life. This new life is given to a person when his old self has died and been buried during baptism (Rom 6:3-4; Col2:12). So considering the use of the words “water” and “washing,” it would be correct to interpret Jn 3:5 and Tit 3:5 as referring to the specific event of baptism.",
        "The word of truth and baptism are not mutually exclusive but are closely related (cf. Eph 5:23). The word of truth includes the command of baptism, and baptism is effective because God’s word has promised salvation through it (Mk 16:16; 1Pet 3:21). It would be a mistake to refer to the birth through the word of truth in order to deny the rebirth through baptism."

        "It would be wrong to assume that Paul rarely baptized people. In Acts alone we read two instances of baptism where Paul was directly involved (Acts 16:33; 19:5).",
        "The context of 1 Corinthians tells us that the Corinthian believers took pride in being the followers of prominent workers of God. Lest anyone took pride in receiving his baptism or claimed that they were baptized into Paul’s name (1 Cor 1:13), Paul reminded them that his mission was not to baptize, but to preach the gospel. Even if it were true that Paul hardly baptized anyone, nowhere does he deny the necessity of baptism. Just because Paul did not personally perform baptism himself does not mean that it wasn’t done or that it had nothing to do with salvation."

        "Jesus is without sin (Jn 8:46; 2Cor 5:21; Heb 4:15).",
        "John’s baptism was a baptism of repentance (Acts 19:4). It did not have the power to cleanse sins since Jesus had not yet offered his body and shed his blood (see Heb 9:26). Only baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus can wash away sins (Acts 2:38; 4:10,12; 10:43).",
        "Jesus was baptized “to fulfill all righteousness” (Mt 3:15), meaning to fulfill the will of God and duty as a man. Jesus, being in the flesh, must also obey the Heavenly Father’s will (see Jn 4:34). His baptism therefore sets an example of obedience to God’s requirements. It also shows us that we need to be baptized to be accepted by God. Incidentally, the correct manner of baptism is demonstrated as well (immersion: “went up out of the water”; see Mt 3:16).",

      "answers": [
        "The apostle John bears witness that from Jesus’ side flowed blood and water (Jn 19:34). In 1 John 5:6, John explains that Jesus did not come by water only (here the water refers to baptism; notice water is mentioned first), but by water and blood, and that it is the Spirit who testifies. In other words, the effect of Jesus’ blood, by the testimony of the Holy Spirit, is present during baptism to cleanse the sin of the person being baptized. Although the candidate’s body is immersed in water physically, yet his spiritual being is cleansed by the blood of Jesus Christ (Heb 10:22 “washed”=immersed).",

        "The definition of baptism itself already denotes how and where one should be baptized (i.e. immersion in living water). If done otherwise, the action could not be called baptism, nor could it carry any effect to cleanse sins.",
        "The way a person is baptized carries great spiritual significance (e.g. bowing of head signifies dying with Christ in the likeness of his death; full immersion signifies complete burial of the old self). And, in addition to this spiritual significance, baptism in the correct manner actually results in the effect of death and burial of the old person and resurrection of the new person (Rom 6:3-5; Col2:12).",
        "Eph 4:5 points out that there is “one Lord, one faith, one baptism”. All true believers of Jesus Christ must believe in the same Lord, hold the same faith, and receive the same baptism. So it is important to know what the Bible says about how one should be baptized.",
        "The baptism of salvation has spiritual power to cleanse sins. The baptism is thus different from the traditional ablution of the Jews or proselyte baptism. It must be performed in the name of the Lord Jesus since a person receiving baptism of salvation is baptized into Christ, who forgives sins through baptism (Gal 3:27; Acts 2:38); He is not simply following a ritual.",

      "answers": [
        "Naaman was cleansed when he followed Elisha’s instructions (2Ki 5:10-14). The ten men with leprosy were healed as they went on the way according to the Lord’s words (Lk 17:11-14). The blind man received his sight when he obeyed the Lord and washed in the Pool of Siloam (Jn 9:6-7). In each of these instances, it was the grace and power of God, not the action of the person that saved them. But their willingness to obey showed their faith in God, and through their obedience, God’s healing took its effect on them.",
        "The mode of baptism in itself does not save us. We are saved by grace through faith. But it is wrong to reduce baptism to mere “procedures” we go through. Baptism is our Lord’s command, and the cleansing is made effective through God’s word (Eph 2:26). During baptism, God acts to bring us salvation (Col2:11-12). We, in turn, receive God’s grace by receiving baptism in obedience to his word.",
        "It is wrong to trivialize the biblical way of baptism. Faith means being willing to obey God’s word even if it appears trivial and doesn’t seem to make sense. It is such faith that God looks for. By imitating the Lord and the apostles in baptism, we aim to follow God’s word as closely as possible. If we claim to have faith but do not want to obey God’s will, we cannot receive God’s grace of salvation.",
        "Other than the grace of God and the atonement of Jesus Christ, the effect of baptism comes from the presence of the Holy Spirit (Jn 20:21-23; 1Jn 5:6-9). God has established the True Jesus Church with the Holy Spirit, revealed to her the truth of salvation, and confirmed the truth with the works of the Holy Spirit. In particular, God has revealed to her the “one baptism” according to the Bible (Eph 4:5). Through our faith in the word of God as revealed by the Holy Spirit and through the testimony of the Holy Spirit, our sins are washed away by the blood of Christ during baptism. So it is important for us to receive the baptism of the True Jesus Church because of the perfect gospel that she preaches and the presence of the Holy Spirit in this church. The issue once again boils down to whether we have the faith to humbly obey God’s will, which he has revealed and testified to with the Holy Spirit."
